# A Model for the Human Genome
This example shows a simple simulation of 24 block copolymers that is a good model of the Human Genome in hoomd.

Hoomd can be downloaded from: http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/
On Linux and MacOS type:
>$ conda config --add channels glotzer
>$ conda install hoomd

Unfortunatly Hoomd does not currently compile or run on Windows.
If GPU computation is required on MacOS Hoomd must be compiled from source.

The human genome consists of 24 chromosomes with a total size of 3Gb.  Aiden et al. 2014 produced a 1kB resolution Genome Contact Map(below single gene resolution).  Contact domains (âˆ¼185 kb) segregate into six nuclear subcompartments with distinct histone marks.

## We begin with a random polymer model

## Models

1. <a href="https://github.com/fergusonml/Human-Genome-Model/blob/master/create%20random%20polymer.ipynb">Random Polymer Model</a>
This simulates a random polymer of 100 beads.

2. <a href="https://github.com/fergusonml/Human-Genome-Model/blob/master/create%20random%20polymer2.ipynb">Block CoPolymer Model</a>
This simulates a block copolymer of 1000 beads.  It will run on a cpu or a gpu which can be changed using the command >hoomd.context.initialize(--mode=cpu)
or
>hoomd.context.initialize(--mode=gpu)

Once context is initialized the python kernel must be restarted to change it.

3. <a href="https://github.com/fergusonml/Human-Genome-Model/blob/master/human_genome_180kb_resolution.ipynb">A Model for the Human Genome at 100kb resolution</a>
This simulates 24 block copolymers of 1000 beads each.  Here each bead approximates a single contact domain (e.g. an enhancer promoter loop).  It will run on a cpu or a gpu.  Which can be changed via hoomd.context.initialize() as described above.

4. <a href="https://github.com/fergusonml/Human-Genome-Model/blob/master/human_genome_10kb_resolution.ipynb">A Model for the Human Genome at 10kb resolution</a>
This simulates 24 block copolymer of 10000 beads.  Here each bead approximates a single gene.  This model will run only on an NVIDIA GPU.
